## 👋 Introduction

I’m originally from [**Gwangju, South Korea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju). After majoring in **Chemistry**, **Nanoscience**, and **Computer Engineering**, I worked as a [software developer](./assets/pdfs/Portfolio.pdf) for three years.  
Currently, I am based in the **U.S.**, where I focus on advancing classical–quantum simulation and introducing machine learning approaches for scientific computing.  
Beyond research, I'm really into the Aerospace industry ✈️ (but not quite upto Cosmology).  
My life motto is: *"Quantity leads to quality."* 
In my free time, I enjoy:

- **🔨 Building** — anything from the ground up (food, furniture, clone coding of websites)  
- **✍️ Writing** — blog posts and web novels  
- **📚 Reading** — classical literature from China and Japan (e.g. 聊齋志異, 紅樓夢, 羅生門)
