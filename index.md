## 👋 Introduction

I’m originally from [Gwangju, South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju). After majoring in Chemistry, Nanoscience, and Computer Engineering, I worked as a [software developer](./assets/Portfolio.pdf) in Seoul for three years.  
I moved to the U.S. largely for my partner—the classic two-body problem—and began a Ph.D. a bit tentatively; but luckily and happily, I’ve since become increasingly captivated by the research itself.\\
Beyond research, I'm really into the Aerospace industry ✈️ (but not quite up to Cosmology).  
My life mottos are *Quantity leads to quality* and *Fake it till you make it*\\
In my free time, I enjoy:
- **Building** — end-to-end projects (websites, automation tools, iOS apps; plus food & furniture).
- **Reading** — (classical) literatures from China and Japan (e.g. 聊齋志異, 紅樓夢, 羅生門)
