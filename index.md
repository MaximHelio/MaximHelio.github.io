## About

I am a Lane Fellow at the [Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/) in [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), working with Professor [Ziv Bar-Joseph](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/). Previously, I was a research fellow in the [Daifeng Wang Laboratory](https://daifengwanglab.org/) at the [Waisman Center](https://www.waisman.wisc.edu/), [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/). I earned my PhD in  [Computer Science](https://cs.stonybrook.edu/) from [Stony Brook University](https://stonybrook.edu/) .

My current research interest lies in machine learning on graphs and manifolds, and their applications for understanding molecular mechanisms and improving genotype-phenotype predictions in complex biological systems. Additionally, I am interested in the ethical, epistemological, and societal aspects of AI/ML, such as machine learning fairness, explainability in AI, data-driven scientific discoveries, and AI for social good.
