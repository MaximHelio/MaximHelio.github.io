## About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Deparment of Computer Science](https://cs.stonybrook.edu/) at [Stony Brook University](https://stonybrook.edu/). I am also a research fellow in [Daifeng Wang Laboratory](https://daifengwanglab.org) in [Waisman Center](https://www.waisman.wisc.edu) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). I specialize in Machine Learning and Bioinformatics.
