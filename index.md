# 👋 Introduction
I’m originally from [**Gwangju, South Korea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju).  
After majoring in **Chemistry**, **Nanoscience**, and **Computer Engineering**, I worked as a [software developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haejung-koh/) for three years.  

Currently, I am a 2nd year of phd student at Chemistry department in UW-Madison, working with Professor Matthew Otten. 

Beyond research, I'm really into the Aerospace industry ✈️ (but not quite upto Cosmology).  
My life motto is: *"Quantity leads to quality."*

## 🌱 Beyond Research

In my free time, I enjoy:

- **🔨 Building** — anything from the ground up (food, furniture, clone coding of websites)  
- **✍️ Writing** — [blog posts](https://github.com/MaximHelio) and web novels  
- **📚 Reading** — classical literature from China and Japan  
  *(e.g.,* [聊齋志異 (*Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Tales_from_a_Chinese_Studio),  
  [紅樓夢 (*Dream of the Red Chamber*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber),  
  [羅生門 (*Rashōmon*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_(short_story))*)*
