## 👋 Introduction

I’m originally from [Gwangju, South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju). After majoring in Chemistry, Nanoscience, and Computer Engineering, I worked as a [software developer](./assets/Portfolio.pdf) in Seoul, Korea for three years.  
I initially relocated to the U.S. at my partner’s urging and began the Ph.D. somewhat tentatively, simply curious whether it was a path I could pursue; happily, I’ve been becoming a lot engaged with the research iteself, now.
Beyond research, I'm really into the Aerospace industry ✈️ (but not quite upto Cosmology).  
My life motto is *Quantity leads to quality.*
In my free time, I enjoy:
- **Building** — anything from the ground up (e.g. food, furniture, clone coding of websites)  
- **Reading** — classical literature from China and Japan (e.g. 聊齋志異, 紅樓夢, 羅生門)
