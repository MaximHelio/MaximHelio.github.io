## About

I am a Lane Fellow at the [Computational Biology Department](https://cbd.cmu.edu/) in [School of I’m originally from [**Gwangju, South Korea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju).  
After majoring in **Chemistry**, **Nanoscience**, and **Computer Engineering**, I worked as a [software developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haejung-koh/) for three years.  

Currently, I am based in the **U.S.**, where I focus on classical–quantum simulation and machine learning approaches for scientific computing.  

Beyond research, I'm really into the Aerospace industry ✈️ (but not quite upto Cosmology).  
My life motto is: *"Quantity leads to quality."*  
## 
In my free time, I enjoy:

- **🔨 Building** — anything from the ground up (food, furniture, web/app)  
- **✍️ Writing** — [blog posts](https://github.com/MaximHelio) and web novels  
- **📚 Reading** — classical literature from China and Japan  
  *(e.g.,* [聊齋志異 (*Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Tales_from_a_Chinese_Studio),  
  [紅樓夢 (*Dream of the Red Chamber*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_of_the_Red_Chamber),
