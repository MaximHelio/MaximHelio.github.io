## About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science](https://cs.stonybrook.edu/) at [Stony Brook University](https://stonybrook.edu/), and a research fellow in [Daifeng Wang Laboratory](https://daifengwanglab.org) in [Waisman Center](https://www.waisman.wisc.edu) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). My current research interest is machine learning on graphs and manifolds, and their applications for understanding molecular mechanisms and improving genotype-phenotype predictions in complex biological systems. I am also interested in ethical/epistemological/social aspects of AI/ML (e.g., machine learning fairness, explainability in AI/data-driven scientific discoveries, AI for social good). I earned my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn).
