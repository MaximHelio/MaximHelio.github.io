## About

I’m originally from [Gwangju, South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwangju). After majoring in Chemistry and Computer Engineering, I worked as a [software developer](./assets/Portfolio.pdf) in Seoul for three years. What first led me to the U.S. was to solve the ‘two-body problem’ with my partner; yet luckily and happily, I have since become deeply engaged in the research, where I've discovered a more certain sense of purpose.

My current research interests lie in advancing predictive simulations of molecules and materials by (i) improving scalable electronic-structure methods (HCI, DFT), (ii) developing hybrid quantum–classical surrogate models for chemistry as the most decent applications of quantum computing, and (iii) building reliable excited-state dynamics workflows with quantified uncertainty. Broadly, I am always keen on AI/ML tools including LLMs to accelerate modeling and enhance decision-making within scientific computing.

Beyond my research, I enjoy exploring the fields of aerospace and laser photochemistry.\\
In my free time, I enjoy:
- **Building** — end-to-end projects (e.g. furniture, food, automation tools for my real purposes)
- **Reading** — (classical) literatures from China and Japan (e.g. 三體, 聊齋志異, 紅樓夢, 羅生門)
