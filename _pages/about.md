Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the
[Deparment of Computer Science](https://cs.stonybrook.edu/) at
[Stony Brook University](https://stonybrook.edu/). I am also a
research fellow in [Daifeng Wang Laboratory](https://daifengwanglab.org) in [Waisman Center](https://www.waisman.wisc.edu) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu). I specialize in Machine Learning and Bioinformatics. I earned
my B.Eng. in Computer Science from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn).

My work has been [published](publications) in
*Bioinformatics*, *PLOS Computational Biology*,
and *BMC Genomics*. My [research](research) 
# explores the
# causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods
# such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I
# primarily focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political
# phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft. I have
# [teaching](teaching) experience in both international relations and quantitative
